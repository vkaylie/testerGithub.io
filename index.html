<h1><b>The New 7 Wonders of The World</h1></b>
<p>
    For centuries, human civilizations have built cities, monuments, buildings, temples, and other structures that awe many. So in 2007, the New7Wonders Foundation took the initiative to make a new list of the seven wonders, selecting 200 monuments around the world and putting it on a poll. The 21 finalists were chosen from this list, and the top seven emerged as the new 7 Wonders of the World.
<ul><li>
    <b><h3>Great Wall of China</h3></b>
    The Great Wall of China is easily one of the most popular tourist attractions in the world. The Great Wall of China measures up to be 5,500 or 8,850 km long. However, in a Chinese study, it claims to be 13,170 miles or 21,200 km. The Wall is more than 2,300 years old.  

    
        <u>When Was It Built?</u>
        It was built in different areas by different states/dynasties to protect their borders. The Zhou Dynasty, ruling from 770-221 BC, started building the Great Wall of China. The Qin Dynasty, ruling from 221-207 BC, linked the Great Wall sections onto the northern border. The Han Dynasty, ruling from 206 BC- 220 AD, extended the Wall west to Yumen Pass and beyond. Lastly, the Ming Dynasty, ruled from 1368-1644, the Hero General Qi Jiguang rebuilt the Great Wall around Beijing. Note that the Ming Dynasty has dramatically built upon the Wall than the other dynasties.
        <u>The Reasons For Its Troubles</u>
        The Great Wall was built to prevent invasions and protect the silk road trade. Despite being made for protection from attacks, the Wall largely failed to provide actual security. Instead, scholars have noted that it served more as “political propaganda.”
        <u>The Heldhold of the Wall</u> 
        It was built by the hands of: soldiers, convicts, peasants, and rebels. They had to deliver the materials by: hand, rope, cart, or with the use of goats. However, building the Great Wall was dangerous, as they did not have safety measures in place. Over 400,000 workers have died building this Wall. The workers who have died to the Wall are a part of the Wall. To make the Wall, they used stone, soil, sand, and brick. However, the most crucial part of the materials is sticky rice. Sticky rice is made of limestone that has been heated to a high temperature, rice, and water. Using sticky rice as a construction ingredient was noted as one of the greatest innovations of the Ming Dynasty. The first segments were built in the fifth century BC, and the last contributions of the Great Wall of China were built in the sixteenth century AD. Making the Wall several centuries-long project.

    <b><h3>Christ The Redeemer Statue</h3></b>
    Christ the Redeemer is a giant Jesus Christ statue, towering 98 feet or 30 metres tall. Horizontally, the arm spanning is 92 feet or 28 metres. Christ the Redeemer stands at the summit of Mount Corcovado in Rio de Janeiro, southeastern Brazil. It is the most massive Art deco sculpture in the world. However, during a storm in 2014, it was hit with lightning, and Jesus’s right thumb was damaged. 

    <u>When Was It Built?</u>
    It was built just after World War 1, where some Brazilians feared a “tide of godlessness. “They proposed a statue. Christ the Redeemer was designed by Heitor da Silva Costa, Carlos Oswald, and Paul Landowski. The building started in 1926, and after five years, it was finished.  

    <u>Why on Mount Corcovado?</u>
    In the 1850s, the Vincentian priest Pedro Maria Boss suggested putting a Christian monument on Mount Corcovado to honor a princess regent of Brazil and the daughter of Emperor Pedro the second, Isabel. However, the project was never approved. In 1921, the Roman Catholic archdiocese of Rio de Janeiro suggested building a statue of Christ on the Mount. They wanted it on Mount Corcovado so that it would be visible from anywhere in Rio. Pres. Epitácio Pessoa approved of this statue.
    <u>How Was It Built?</u>
    Christ the Redeemer is made of reinforced concrete and is covered in approximately six million tiles. Once permission was granted, the foundation stone of the base was laid on April 04, 1922. Later that same year, a competition was held to find a designer for the statue. Heitor da Silva Costa was chosen on the basis of his sketches. His sketches were of a figure of Christ holding a cross in his right hand and the world in his left. However, he dropped that idea in collaboration with a Brazilian artist Carolos Oswald and Silva Costa. Oswald has been credited with the idea for the figure’s standing pose with arms spread wide. A French sculptor, Paul Landowski, helped with the final design. Landowski was credited as the primary designer of the figure’s head and hands. The costs of the statue were raised privately, but they had the help of a church. The cost of the project was $250,000 back in 1926; in 2020, it now costs about $3.4 million.

    <b><h3>Machu Picchu</h3></b>
    This Incan civilization, located near Cuzco, Peru, was discovered in 1911 by Hiram Bingham. At first, Bingham thought it was Vilcabamba, a secret Incan stronghold used during the 16th-century rebellion against Spanish rule. Machu Picchu has about 200 structures for the religious, ceremonial, astronomical, and agricultural activities they did. The city is divided into a lower and upper part, separating the farming from the residential areas.
    <u>The Secrets of an Unknown Land</u>
    Scholars have come up with many other ideas on what this civilization serves as: perhaps for confounded scholars, home to women who live in convents under a vow of chastity, a pilgrimage site, or a royal retreat. Despite all these theories, none of them was proved correct.
    <u>The Mountain Life</u>
    It was built in the rocky countryside of Cuzo, Peru. It was in the middle of a tropical mountain forest on the Andes Mountains. Machu Picchu’s Wall, terraces, stairways, and ramps blend seamlessly into its natural setting. Its settings are frequent to earthquakes, yet Machu Picchu has been standing strong for thousands of years. It was built more than 2,400 meters above sea level and covers 32,592 hectares of land.

    <u>The Stones of Earth Shall Withstand the Earth</u>
    Stone was used to building Machu Picchu; these stones used no mortar. They were cut so precisely, and wedged so closely together, that a credit card cannot be inserted between them. When an earthquake occurs, the stones start to dance upon themselves, then simply fall back. The Inca was incredibly advanced for a civilization that used no draft animals, iron tools, or wheels. Yet, scholars have wondered how the Inca could build from such a high ground and withstand earthquakes. The answer is an underground building. The engineer Kenneth Wright has estimated that 60% of the construction done at Machu Picchu was underground. The underground is made up of deep building foundation and crushed rock used as drainage. This drainage is especially important because the rainy season is harsh around Machu Picchu.

    <b><h3>Chichen Itza</h3></b>
    Chichen Itza was a Mayan city on the Yucatan peninsula in Mexico. Chichen Itza provides us the culture and accomplishments of the Mayan people. The name Chichen Itza is a Mayan language term for “at the mouth of the well of the Itza.” The Itza were an ethnic group of Mayans. They had risen to power in the northern part of the Yucatan peninsula, where the city is located. Chichen Itza was built around 415 to 455 AD,

    <u>Where was It Made?</u>
    Chichen Itza was built in an area of rough terrain that was leveled in order to support more substantial structures, like El Castillo. Chichen Itza is located about 120 miles from the modern-day resort town of Cancun, on Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula. Underneath were several underground rivers; this serves as the water source of Chichen Itza. And it makes a perfect location for a city.  

    <u>The Importance of Chichen-Itza</u>
    Chichen-Itza provides us the culture and accomplishments of the Mayan people. The second settlement of Chichen-Itza is the most important for historians because it corresponds to the migration of Toltec warriors from the Mexican plateau.  
    <u>The Buildings Of Chichen-Itza</u>
    The Mayan were much more advanced than other civilizations. All of the buildings of Chichen Itza were linked by a network of nearly 100 “sacbeob,” or paved roadways and sidewalks. The closed roads were significant because many European cities did not yet have paved streets. The earliest structures are to the south of the central Plaza. They include: the Akab Dzib (House of the Dark Writing), the Iglesia (church), the Casa de las Monjas (Nunnery), and the observatory El Caracol (The Snail). There is evidence that, in the 10th century, after the collapse of the Maya cities of the southern lowlands, Chichen was invaded by foreigners. These invaders were responsible for the construction of such significant buildings as El Castillo. It is a pyramid that rises 79 feet (24 metres) above the Main Plaza.

    <b><h3>The Roman Colosseum</h3></b>
    The Roman Colosseum was built in the first century by order of Emperor Vespasian as a gift to the Roman people. The Colosseum is capable of holding 50,000 spectators. According to some estimates, about 500,000 people died in the Colosseum. Additionally, so many animals were captured and then killed there that a particular species reportedly became extinct.  

    <u>The Joy of Death Games</u>
    The Colosseum was a place to watch many events. The most notable events were the gladiator fights. Men battling animals was also common. Water was sometimes pumped into the Colosseum for mock naval engagements.

    <u>How was It Built?</u>
    Measuring some 620 by 513 feet, or 190 by 155 meters, the Colosseum was the largest amphitheater in the Roman world. Unlike many earlier amphitheaters, usually dug into hillsides to provide adequate support, the Colosseum was a freestanding structure made of stone and concrete. It has three stores of arched entrances.  
    <u>The Damages of The Colosseum</u>
    The Colosseum was damaged by lightning and earthquakes in medieval times and, even more severely, by vandalism. All the marble seats and decorative material disappeared. The site was treated as little more than a quarry for more than 1,000 years. The restoration project began in the 1990s by Pius ⅤⅢ.

    <b><h3>Taj Mahal</h3></b>
    The Taj Mahal, a mausoleum complex, located in Agram India is known as one of the world’s most iconic monuments and is perhaps the most beautiful example of Mughal architecture. It was built by Emperor Shah Jahan in 1632, to honor his wife, Mumtaz Mahal. The construction started in 1632 AD and was completed in 1648 Ad, taking 16 years to build. 

    <u>The Immense Architecture Perfection of The Taj Mahal</u>
    The mausoleum complex was influenced by Indian, Persian, and Islamic architecture. At its center is the Taj Mahal itself, built of shimmering white marble that can change color depending on the daylight. For its construction, masons, stone-cutters, in layers, carver, painters, calligraphers, dome builders, and other artisans were requisitioned from the empire and Central Asia and Iran. More than 20,000 workers were employed. Ustad-Ahmad Lahori was the leading architect of the Taj Mahal. Taj Mahal is a perfect symmetrical planned building. The building material used is the brick-in-lime mortar with red sandstone and marble and inlay work of precious/semi-precious stones. Taj Mahal represents the most magnificent architectural and artistic achievement through perfect harmony and excellent craftsmanship in a whole range of Indo-Islamic sepulchral architecture. It is a masterpiece of architectural style in conception, treatment, and execution. It has unique aesthetic qualities in balance, symmetry, and harmonious blending of various elements.
     <u>Where was It Built?</u>
     Taj Mahal is located on the right bank of the Yamuna river. It has a vast Mughal garden that encompasses nearly 17 hectares.

    <b><h3>Petra</h3></b>
    Petra is an ancient city, and it is the center of an Arab kingdom in Hellenistic and Roman times. The ruins of which are in southwest Jordan. The town was built on a terrace. Petra is half-built, half-carved into the rock, and is surrounded by mountains riddled with passages and gorges. It is one of the world’s most famous archaeological sites. It is where ancient Eastern traditions blend with Hellenistic architecture.
    
    <u>Living in a Rock</u>
    Nabataeans, an Arab tribe, occupied the land of Petra and made it the capital of their kingdom. In 312 BCE, the region was attacked by Seleucid Forces, but they failed to seize the city. Under the Nabataean rule, Petra prospered as the center of the spice trade. The population was around 10,000 to 30,000. Then in 106 CE, the Romans attacked and was able to capture Petra, making it a part of the Roman province. Two significant earthquakes hit Petra and made life harder in Petra, resulting in it being abandoned. One earthquake happened in 363 CE and the other in 551.
    <u>Carving The City Set in Stone</u>
    Not much is known about Petra, like how it was built. However, there is evidence that they used the techniques of quarrying and rock cutting. However, it is truly unknown. 
    <u>The Irony of Water Management in Petra</u>
    Petra has an ingenious water management system that allows extensive settlement within a dry area. There are the remnants of the diversion dam, Muslim tunnel, water channels, aqueducts, reservoirs, and cisterns. The rainy season of the Petra only comes for a few days, and the rest of the year is dry. So the Nabataeans decided to make a water reserve to store the rainwater. They are often pools of water and tunnels running through the city.
